## Introduction
This is an educational project which was guided and inspired by a code example within the book "Programming Rust (Second Edition): Fast, Safe Systems Development" by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff & Leonora F.S. Tindall (O'Reilly).  This project was created with assistance from ChatGPT as well. 

## What this code does
This program is designed to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD), also known as greatest common factor (GCF), of two user-provided integers.
